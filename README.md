![portada](https://github.com/Ironhack-Data-Madrid-Enero-2022/w7-Kaggle_competition/blob/main/img/Airbnb-inventory-travel-vaccinations.jpg)

## Description

- Find the best machine learning model and params for the given dataset. 

## Instructions

Find the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-ironhack/data).

### Data
#### train.csv
* 1. **Processing/cleaning** the dataset: this should be later modularized in functions.
* 2. **Train** a model (fit & predict) with the data in `train.csv`. This file does contain a **y**.
        - Do *train, test, split* on `train.csv` if necessary.
        - Choose the best model regarding the metrics. In this case, the lowest RMSE (error).

        2.1. **Export** the model: we don't want to invest time/RAM resources on training the model again in the future.

#### test.csv
* 3. Apply the same **cleaning** to `test.csv`. This files does NOT contain a **y**.
* 4. We'll apply the already **trained model** from step 2 to the `text.csv` file. With this we'l√±l generate a new column with the predicted values.  

#### my_submission.csv
* 5. Generate a `submission.csv` file with only two columns: the **ID** of the diamond & the predicted **price** (y).


## Deliverables

- **Jupyter notebooks** where you show the process you followed to get to your submissions.

- A **slide** (.ppt, ipynb, etc) with a summary of the metrics you obtained and the rationale behind it. 
    - Why do those params work better than others?

## Deadline

+ Thursday 24 February 2022 23:59

+ Project presentations will be held on Friday 25 February 2022.

## Tips
- Take advantage of the daily submissions. Try at least one today!
